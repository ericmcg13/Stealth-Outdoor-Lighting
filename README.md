# Stealth-Outdoor-Lighting

Small business app for Stealth Outdoor Lighting systems based in Michigan, USA
www.stealthoutdoorlighting.com (website is pretty lackluster)

This app makes it easy for clients to contact Stealth and request quotes, repairs, or view a showcase of previous projects.
Development will include a password protected price book for Stealth Lighting designers as well as refined repair requests 
that will include the clients address for easy navigation.

App features are currently being tested with TestFlight
